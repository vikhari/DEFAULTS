SETTINGS - MOUSE MAPPINGS
----------------------------------

Keys on left and right side of mouse can be flipped. The mappings below are intended for right-handers.
Tab switching is present in more applications and therefore more frequently used than backward/forward.

These mouse mappings aim to complement the cross-OS keyboard mappings (found in CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt and SETTINGS-KEYBOARD-MAPPINGS.txt),
as well as to perform the most common actions one may want to perform without touching the keybaord:
- switching tabs to read,
- changing windows to read,
- navigating between pages,
- & performing searches to begin/find new things to read.
Tasks like copy-pasting-running terminal commands becomes a breeze without needing to change hand placement.

For example, this series of web browsing actions can be done without a keyboard:
00 initial Google search (requires keyboard or voice)
01 <RightClick> to open Wikipedia link in a new tab
02 <MoveRightOneTab> to read
03 browse pages via <LeftClick> and <Forwardward/Backward>
04 find a keyword/URL to save for later
05 highlight keyword/URL via <LeftClickAndHold>
06 <Copy> (the copy macro was picked over paste to avoid accidental clipboard pasting)
07 <Overview> to switch workspace and focus on Slack
08 <LeftClick> in a direct message to self
09 <RightClick> to paste
10 <Enter> to send
11 <Overview> to return to browser for more information gathering
This may seem over-analytical but features and habits like this optimize workflow, just as typing speed can.
They can also be useful for technical difficulty situations where keyboards run out of battery or don't work.
The SETTINGS-KEYBOARD-MAPPINGS.txt is derived from a similar vein, one where a mouse is needed as little as possible.

Lines with = :              signify the mapping is a default
Lines with > instead of =:  signify the mapping needs to be set (TODO: tool for this coming soon)

MACROS
----------------------------------
"5+ button" mouse
- Left/Right Click              = defaults
- Left Backward Key             > move left one tab                          (Ctrl + Shift + Tab  in most browsers)
- Left Forward Key              > move right one tab                         (Ctrl + Tab          in most browsers)
- Right Backward Key            = backward                                   (Alt/Command + Left  in most browsers, but this macro often does not need to be set manually)
- Right Forward Key             = forward                                    (Alt/Command + Right in most browsers, but this macro often does not need to be set manually)
- Wheel Click                   > Overview/Mission Control/View Applications (as indicated in CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt; can be used to change workspaces)
- Wheel Left                    = copy
- Wheel Right                   = Enter                                      (this mapping allows you to copy using Wheel Left, click-paste, and Enter to perform searches)
- DPI Up/Down                   > scroll left/right
