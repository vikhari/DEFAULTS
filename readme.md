### Trust the overanalytic, iterative mind of an OC(P)D programmer..

It is not likely many people have thought this much about shortcuts, cross-platform and cross-applicaiton!  
I hope to eventually have some nice GIFs here to more easily convey the elegance of learning these core shortcuts and tools...
That said, the real reason to follow this process is if you agree with the [philosophy](#bare-necessities---forget-about-your-worries--your-strife).  

This is the approximate ideal order to learn shortcuts and build fmailiarity, from the ground up while balancing frequency needed:
```
- Keyboard Shortcuts  (non-programmer essentials)
  - Text; practice typing during this phase too                   (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)  
  - OS Navigation & User Interfaces; OSX Modifiers encouraged     (HARDWARE-KEYBOARD-MAPPINGS.txt & HARDWARE-USER-INTERFACES.txt)
  - Browsers                                                      (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)
  - Office                                                        (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)
  - Other Apps And Services                                       (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)
- Set Custom Shortcuts (non-programmer essentials)
  - Keyboard Macros                                               (HARDWARE-KEYBOARD-MACROS.txt)
  - Mouse Macros                                                  (HARDWARE-MOUSE-MAPPINGS.txt)
- Keyboard Shortcuts  (superduper user essentials)
  - Vim; shell shortcuts seem more intuitive if done first        (CHEATSHEET-VIM.txt)
  - Shells & Useful Commands/Packages (Debian is easiest first)   (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt & APP-LIST-DEB.txt)
  - Editors And IDEs                                              (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)
```
As you make progress through these stages of learning follow the CONFIG- files for instructions on how to set up the apps and integrate things like Vim.

### Bare necessities - forget about your worries and your strife!

The philosophy behind this approach is outlined in detail in the `HARDWARE-KEYBOARD-MAPPINGS.txt` and `HARDWARE-MOUSE-MAPPINGS.txt` files.  
But in summary they aim to:
- Stay at home (the Vim philosophy that minimizes leaving the "home row" of the keyboard as little as possible)
- Have methods of doing the same actions via mouse or keyboard or single hand, avoiding neeidng to change positions
- Keep the list mostly to the essentials, meaning they are actions that will be performed frequently
- Avoiding application bloat by having too many applications that do similar things (high number of actions, low number of tools; see `APP-LIST-XXX.txt` files)
- Help in odd circumstances (e.g. use keyboard shortcut to move a window over to laptop if monitor not working, or be able to browse via only mouse from couch)
- Build skills that make a programmer versed in all core types of opeerating systems, environments, and applications
