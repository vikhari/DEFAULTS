### Trust the overanalytic, iterative mind of an OC(P)D programmer..

It is not likely many people have thought this much about shortcuts, cross-platform and cross-applicaiton!  
That said, the real reason to follow this process is if you agree with the [philosophy](#bare-necessities---forget-about-your-worries--your-strife).  

This is the approximate ideal order to learn shortcuts and build fmailiarity, from the ground up while balancing frequency needed:
```
- Keyboard Shortcuts  (non-programmer essentials)
  - Text; practice typing during this phase too                   (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)  
  - OS Navigation & User Interfaces; OSX Modifiers encouraged     (SETTINGS-KEYBOARD-MAPPINGS.txt & SETTINGS-USER-INTERFACES.txt)
  - Browsers                                                      (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)
  - Office                                                        (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)
  - Other Apps And Services                                       (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)
- Set Custom Shortcuts (non-programmer essentials)
  - Keyboard Macros                                               (SETTINGS-KEYBOARD-MACROS.txt)
  - Mouse Macros                                                  (SETTINGS-MOUSE-MAPPINGS.txt)
- Keyboard Shortcuts  (superduper user essentials)
  - Vim; shell shortcuts seem more intuitive if done first        (CHEATSHEET-VIM.txt)
  - Shells & Commands                                             (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt & CHEATSHEET-COMMANDS.txt)
  - Editors And IDEs                                              (CHEATSHEET-SHORTCUTS.txt)
```
As you make progress through these stages of learning follow the CONFIG- files for instructions on how to set up the apps and integrate things like Vim.

### Bare necessities - forget about your worries and your strife!

The philosophy behind this approach is outlined in detail in the `SETTINGS-KEYBOARD-MAPPINGS.txt` and `SETTINGS-MOUSE-MAPPINGS.txt` files.  
But in summary they aim to:
- "Stay at home" (the Vim philosophy is to leave the "home row" of the keyboard as little as necessary)
- Have methods of doing the same actions via mouse or keyboard or single hand, avoiding neeidng to change positions
- Keep the list mostly to the essentials, meaning they are actions that will be performed frequently
- Avoiding application bloat by having too many applications that do similar things (high number of actions, low number of tools)
- Help in odd circumstances (e.g. use keyboard shortcut to move a window over to laptop if monitor not working, or be able to browse via only mouse from couch)
- Build skills that make a programmer versed in all core types of opeerating systems, environments, and applications
