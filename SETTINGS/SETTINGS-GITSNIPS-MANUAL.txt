----------------------------------
SETTINGS - GITLAB SNIPPETS (MANUAL)
----------------------------------

GitLab snippets support being cloned and maintained just like code repositories, practical for:
- backup and availability across devices 
- collaboration (by sharing your personal notes others can help more effectively with commands/errors/logs)
- have multiple levels of organization (parent folder, snippets, 10 files per snippet, sections within each file)
- temporary notes waiting to be filed away elsewhere - revision helps stay better organized, rather than filing and later needing reorganizing

----------------------------------
CREATE SNIPPETS
----------------------------------
- Create at least 2 snippets.
- Rename them from snippetfile#.txt to snip_logs and snip_notes.
- As in the next sections create new files (up to 10 per snippet) to track useful things - what is shown below is just a recommendation...do you!
- Put the snippets in a parent folder so that the structure is now something like my_git_snips/snip_logs/commands.log.

----------------------------------
SETUP TEMPLATES
----------------------------------
LOGS  			(title of snippets can be changed in GitLab web interface for a snippet)
- TEMP.log		= temp stuff (to be deleted or filed into below later)
- commands.log		= commands from troubleshooting or practically anything else
- directories.log	= directories on different nodes/for different services
- errors.log		= warnings/errors with notes about cause, explanation, and/or solution
- variables.log		= environemnt variables
-----------------
NOTES 			(title of snippets can be changed in GitLab web interface for a snippet)
- TEMP.md		= temp stuff (to be deleted or filed into below later)
- cuts.md		= shortcuts for reference at any time
- guis.md		= application or web UI directions or explanations/notes
- sets.md		= settings for various things that you want to remember, and if OCD transfer to a repo like this one ;)
- tool.md		= tools that you found useful or for which you want to retain usage notes
- urls.md		= addresses for frontends or subdomains visited commonly or for testing
