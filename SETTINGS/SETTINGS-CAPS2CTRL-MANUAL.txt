SETTINGS - CAPS TO CTRL (MANUAL)
----------------------------------

CapsLock is a completely pointless key for most of us...why waste a key?!
It always surprises me that this has not caught on like Dark Mode,
which I use to think was an obvious accessibility feature, yet it still took years to be implemented at the OS level (RIP Flux).

There are some reasons every day is exactly the same:
- In sensitive environments administrators lockdown applicaitons and registry edits that can be performed (remapped keys could be attacked).
- Many people don't realize just how dramatically their life could be changed by remapping the key.
- There has not been enough push back (unlike Dark Mode) for a consensus to buid on what the new mapping should be.

That said, if you have viewed HARDWARE-KEYBOARD-MAPPINGS.txt you will see that even OSX still has a similar usage of Command key to Ctrl.
I've become extremely fast with navigating CLI, editing/typing, and shortcutting because of mapping CapsLock to Ctrl (or swapping them).

Of course, to me the most important and overwhelmingly convincing reason is that it is simply much more ergonomic for your hands.
This is mirrored by the fact that keyboards like the CODE v2 by WASD implement dipswitches just so that you can do it even when admins don't allow via OS.

There are multiple ways to achieve this remapping.
In Windows, registry changes are the best as they attack the root cause and change the functionality within the OS itself instead of capturing the keycode.
However, if RegEdit changes are blocked for you, AutoHotKey or Microsoft PowerToys provide good alternatives
(albeit not as good: https://documentation.help/AHK_H-2.0/Remap.htm).
