MOUSE SHORTCUTS - CUSTOM
----------------------------------

These mouse mappings aim to complement the cross-OS keyboard mappings (found in SHORTCUTS-DEFAULT.txt and SHORTCUTS-CUSTOM.txt),
as well as to perform the most common actions one may want to perform without touching the keybaord:
- switching tabs to read,
- changing windows to read,
- navigating between pages,
- & performing searches to begin/find new things to read.

Lines with = :              signify the mapping is a default
Lines with > instead of =:  signify the mapping needs to be set (TODO: tool for this coming soon)

"5+ button" mouse
- Left/Right Click              = defaults

- Left Forward Key              > move right one tab                         (Ctrl + Tab          in most browsers)

- Wheel Right                   = Enter                                      (this mapping allows you to copy using Wheel Left, click-paste, and Enter to perform searches)
